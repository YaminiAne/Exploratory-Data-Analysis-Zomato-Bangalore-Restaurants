# Exploratory Data Analysis: Zomato Bangalore Restaurants
# Introduction
With the rise of meal delivery services, everyone can now enjoy their favorite restaurant food from the comfort of their own home. Giant food aggregators and food shipping companies like Zomato have made it feasible. Zomato is one of India’s most extensively used services for searching restaurants, ordering food online, making table reservations, etc. Bangalore, home to many restaurants and cuisines worldwide, has over 12,000 restaurants doing their business through systems like Zomato. This wide variety is exponentially increasing each day.

The goal of this data analysis is to comprehend the factors that influence the establishment of restaurants in various locations throughout Bangalore; these factors include aggregate consumer score, cuisines offered, type of service provided, and numerous others. With increasingly more eating places, it’s becoming harder for restaurants to run successfully, particularly in a metropolitan metropolis like Bangalore.
